The "Mushroom hunting" project is an interactive forest generated using cellular automata. Trees are positioned on inactive cells, while live cells create pathways. Randomly scattered along these pathways are mushrooms that users can gather. The application is developed in React + Vite with the use of the Three.js library, providing visually appealing and interactive exploration of the virtual forest. Embark on a stroll through this magical world and enjoy collecting mushrooms!
